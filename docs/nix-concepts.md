# Nix Concepts Guide

As the ancient scrolls of Nixus, the Package Provider, teach us, understanding the core concepts of Nix is essential for harnessing its power. This guide will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of Nix.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Pure Functions

Nix is based on the concept of pure functions from functional programming:
- Given the same inputs, a pure function always produces the same outputs
- Pure functions have no side effects

This is why Nix builds are reproducible - the same inputs always produce the same result.

### 2. The Nix Store

The Nix store (`/nix/store`) is where all packages are stored:
- Each package has a unique path that includes a hash of all its inputs
- Example: `/nix/store/2c5rw6493qw9nsvzq3jkwhv2y39fh9p0-firefox-91.0.2`
- Packages in the store are immutable (never change after being built)

### 3. Nix Language

Nix has its own functional language for writing package definitions:
- Lazy evaluation
- No side effects
- Used to describe how to build packages

Example of a simple Nix expression:
```nix
{ stdenv, fetchurl }:

stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "hello-2.10";
  
  src = fetchurl {
    url = "https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.10.tar.gz";
    sha256 = "0ssi1wpaf7plaswqqjwigppsg5fyh99vdlb9kzl7c9lng89ndq1i";
  };
}
```

### 4. Derivations

A derivation is a description of how to build a package:
- Inputs (dependencies, source code)
- Build script
- Environment variables

When you build a derivation, Nix:
1. Ensures all dependencies are available
2. Sets up an isolated build environment
3. Runs the build script
4. Stores the result in the Nix store

### 5. Nix Profiles

Profiles are collections of packages that are made available to users:
- Each user has their own profile at `~/.nix-profile`
- System profiles at `/run/current-system`
- Profiles are just symlinks to packages in the Nix store

### 6. Channels and Flakes

Channels are collections of packages and expressions:
- Traditional way to get packages: `nixpkgs-unstable`, `nixos-21.05`, etc.

Flakes are the newer, more reproducible way to manage dependencies:
- Explicit dependencies with locked versions
- Standardized outputs
- Improved reproducibility

## Nix vs. NixOS vs. Home Manager

### Nix
- The package manager
- Can be installed on any Linux distribution or macOS
- Manages packages in isolation from the system package manager

### NixOS
- A Linux distribution built on Nix
- The entire operating system is managed as a Nix derivation
- System configuration is declarative

### Home Manager
- Manages user environment and dotfiles
- Can be used with or without NixOS
- Declarative configuration for user programs

## Common Nix Commands

### Package Management
- `nix-env -i package` - Install a package
- `nix-env -e package` - Uninstall a package
- `nix-env -q` - List installed packages
- `nix-env --rollback` - Rollback to previous generation

### Flakes (New CLI)
- `nix develop` - Enter a development environment
- `nix build` - Build a package
- `nix run` - Run a package
- `nix flake update` - Update flake inputs

### Development
- `nix-shell` - Enter a development environment
- `nix-build` - Build a package
- `nix-instantiate` - Evaluate a Nix expression

## Best Practices

1. **Use Flakes** - They provide better reproducibility and a standardized structure
2. **Pin Dependencies** - Always specify exact versions of inputs
3. **Modularize Configurations** - Split complex configurations into modules
4. **Use Home Manager** - For user-specific configurations
5. **Document Your Configurations** - Include comments explaining non-obvious choices
